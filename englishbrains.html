      <h2>Why is it so Difficult to Read English?üßê</h2>

      <p>
        "According to the U.S. Department of Education, 54% of U.S. adults 16-74
        years old - about 130 million people - lack proficiency in literacy,
        reading below the equivalent of a sixth-grade level. A new study by
        Gallup on behalf of the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy
        finds that low levels of adult literacy could be costing the U.S. as
        much as <strong>$2.2 trillion</strong> a year."
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>Wait...<em>WHAT!!</em> More than <strong>HALF</strong> of Americans are NOT proficient in reading?</p>
        <p>But why are so many of Americans struggling with reading their native language? Well...It's all about the human brain!</p>

        The Science of Reading has conducted research on the brain and how the
        brain acquires reading. Since reading is a "new" skill, the human brain
        has not had time to evolve structures and pathways that are adapted
        specifically for written language processing, which is why many people
        struggle to learn to read. Basically, our brains were not made to read English orthography, or the English writing system. 
        <br/><br/>
        Proficient readers use all parts of the brain when they read by linking
        pathways from the back and midle areas to the temporal areas and beyond,
        where the brain processes meangs of words and connected language. The
        temporal lobes are responsible for language comprehension and connecting
        spoken words with their meaning. Humans have only been reading for around 5000 years, which is relatively a short period of time for human brains to evolve and adapt.

        In addition, English brings extra challenges because it is a
        morphophonemic language -- meaning that spellings represent phonemes and
        morphemes. Because of its complexity of being a deep morphophonemic language system, English is one of the hardest languages to learn and read. (Sorry English language learners!üò©)
